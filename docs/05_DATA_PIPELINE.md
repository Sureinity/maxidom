# 05. Data Schema & Feature Specification

This document details the complete data pipeline for the MaxiDOM system, from the raw browser events captured by the client to the final numerical feature vector used by the machine learning model on the backend.

The data progresses through three distinct stages:
1.  **Raw Events**: Granular interaction data captured in real-time.
2.  **Aggregated Payload**: A structured JSON object sent from the client to the server.
3.  **Extracted Features**: The final numerical representation used for model training and scoring.

### 1. Raw DOM Events (Client-Side Capture)

This is the raw data collected by the `content.js` script, listening directly to the browser's DOM.

| DOM Event | Properties Captured | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`mousemove`** | `timeStamp`, `clientX`, `clientY` | Tracks the path and timing of all mouse movements. |
| **`mousedown`** | `timeStamp`, `clientX`, `clientY`, `button` | Marks the start of a click or drag operation. |
| **`mouseup`** | `timeStamp`, `clientX`, `clientY`, `button` | Marks the end of a click or drag operation. |
| **`keydown`** | `timeStamp`, `code` | Marks the moment a physical key is pressed down. |
| **`keyup`** | `timeStamp`, `code` | Marks the moment a physical key is released. |
| **`wheel`** | `timeStamp`, `deltaY` | Captures vertical scroll actions and their magnitude. |
| **`window.focus`** | `timeStamp` | Records when the user switches back to the tab. |
| **`window.blur`** | `timeStamp` | Records when the user switches away from the tab. |

> **Privacy Note**: We capture `event.code` (e.g., `KeyA`, `ShiftLeft`) instead of `event.key` (`a`, `A`). This provides the necessary data for rhythm analysis without recording the actual sensitive characters being typed.

### 2. Aggregated Data Payload (API Contract)

The `background.js` script aggregates the raw events into a structured, efficient JSON payload before sending it to the backend. This is the data format defined by the API contract.

```json
{
  "startTimestamp": 1678890000000,
  "endTimestamp": 1678890120000,
  "windowSize": { "width": 1920, "height": 1080 },

    { "code": "KeyE", "downTime": 1678890005250, "upTime": 1678890005340 }
  ],

  ],

  // A simple list of scroll actions
  "scrollEvents": [
    { "t": 1678890020100, "dy": 100 },
    { "t": 1678890020150, "dy": 120 }
  ],

  // A record of focus changes
  "focusChanges": [
    { "type": "blur", "t": 1678890030000 },
    { "type": "focus", "t": 1678890035000 }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Final Extracted Features (ML Model Input)

The backend's Feature Extraction Engine processes the aggregated payload and produces the following fixed-size numerical vector. This vector is the direct input for the `IsolationForest` model.
